## My process

### Built with

- Flutter
- Dart
- Firebase
- SQLite
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This has been the first time i built a full stack app in Flutter, so it was quite challenging
SQLite was a good choice for this challenge as it's a simple database that can be used to store
comments and replies.
Flutter has a nice way to manage state, which is really useful when you need to update UI after an
action is done.

### Continued development

I will continue studying on layout for the Flutter part and structure for the backend (Dart)

### Useful resources

- [SQLite getting started](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-getting-started/) - This was a good
  resource to setup SQLite for the first time.
- [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/) - Flutter has nice documentation for everything you need
  to know.

## Acknowledgments

Since frontendmentor works with websites and not with app, as a screen result on that site for this
challenge i couldn't get anything other than a blank screen, but VillageR88 gave me a hint to
generate themed loading screen that prevents this to happen, so i added it to the project.
